I, Ajanta Bhoumick, a widow and resident of Bishnupur, am writing to file a complaint against my husband’s elder brother, Sudeep Bhoumick, and his accomplices for continuously harassing and threatening me and my two sons, Mrinal Bhoumick (age 21) and Aditya Bhoumick (age 10).

Sudeep Bhoumick, along with Panchayat members Tapas Panja, Debashish Maal, and his wife’s younger sister Mousomi Chakraborty, has been making my life unbearable. Sudeep Bhoumick (Phone Number: +91-9836112029), Tapas Panja (Phone Number: +91 8777039430), and Mousomi Chakraborty (Phone Number: +91-7003499311) have been continuously threatening me. On several occasions, they have locked my house gate and the collapsible gate, trapping me and my younger son inside.

Despite my attempts to seek help, the local police station, Bishnupur Police Station, has refused to file my FIR. Instead, I was harassed further by a lady police officer known to me as Amrita Madam, who physically assaulted me. I have also filed a complaint with the Superintendent of Police, South 24 Parganas, but have received no response.

Since the death of my husband, Late Shri. Manoranjan Bhoumick, Sudeep Bhoumick has been torturing my sons and me. He has locked the water pump room, denying us access to drinking water. He also consumes the entire pension of my mother-in-law, leaving us with nothing. Previously, he did the same with my late father-in-law’s pension.

Sudeep Bhoumick, along with the Panchayat members, has continuously threatened, slapped, and beaten me in public. This ongoing harassment and abuse have made my life a living nightmare, and I fear for my safety and the safety of my children.

I request immediate action against Sudeep Bhoumick and his accomplices. The law should protect my family and me from these constant threats and violence.

Yours faithfully,

Ajanta Bhoumick
