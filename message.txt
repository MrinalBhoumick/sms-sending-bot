I, Ajanta Bhoumick, a widow from Bishnupur, file a complaint against my husband’s elder brother, Sudeep Bhoumick, and his accomplices for harassment and threats towards me and my sons, Mrinal (21) and Aditya (10).

Sudeep Bhoumick (Phone: +91-9836112029), Tapas Panja (Phone: +91-8777039430), and Mousomi Chakraborty (Phone: +91-7003499311) have trapped us inside our house, locked our water pump room, and denied us drinking water. They consume my mother-in-law’s pension, leaving us with nothing. Despite reporting to the Bishnupur Police and the Superintendent of Police, South 24 Parganas, we received no help. Instead, I was assaulted by a police officer, Amrita Madam.

Since my husband’s death, Sudeep Bhoumick has publicly slapped and beaten me. This ongoing abuse has made our lives unbearable.
